# Grigoria Angelou - Portfolio

## About
Hi! I am Grigoria Angelou. I have a Master Degree in Statistics, a Bachelor in Mathematics,
and I love answering questions. Therefore, I dive into the world of data analysis to fulfill my curiosity.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, track my progress in Data Analysis and share my personal projects.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will try to describe, as briefly as I can, the personal projects that I am doing in order to learn and master new skills in Data Analysis.

### World University Rankings 2016-2024

**Description:** The source of the the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ and it contains information about the universities around the globe and how those rank in many fields (teaching, research environment, research quality etc. and a total score which compare the universities in a total performance. In my analysis I use different methods and visualization to have a better understanding of the dataset and I use a Tableau Dashboard where you can interact and see where each university from different countries rank for the year 2024, track its general rank over the years, compare all the rankings of 2024 with the previous year's performance, check the gender distribution of the university, how many international students prefer it, and which are the top universities in the country that this university belongs. <br>

### Amazon's Product Analysis for year 2019

**Description:** The dataset was downloaded by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ and it contains 12 different csv files, each for every month's sales on Amazon for different products. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, save the results into a csv file for all the months together and finally visualization using different ways with Python and Tableau for an interactive dashboard. <br>

### Student Mental Health

**Description:** The dataset was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University student in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health. The data set was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/  The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values. Vvisualization using pivot tables in Excel. <br>

### Global Life expectancy and Europian Analysis

**Description:** In this project I use a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/ which contains Life expectancy of all the countries for the years and Continents for the years 1543 to 2019. I am using jupyter Notebook to clean explore and visualize my dataset. I am also using IBM Watson Studio in order to make more interactive Dashboards. <br>
