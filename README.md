# Grigoria Angelou - Portfolio

## About
Hi! I am Grigoria Angelou. I have a Master Degree in Statistics, a Bachelor in Mathematics,
and I love answering questions. Therefore, I dive into the world of data analysis to fulfill my curiosity.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, track my progress in Data Analysis and share my personal projects.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will try to describe, as briefly as I can, the personal projects that I am doing in order to learn and master new skills in Data Analysis.

### World University Rankings 2016-2024

**Description:** The source of the the dataset that is used in this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ and contains information about universities around the globe and how those rank in many fields (teaching, research environment, research quality etc. and a total score which compare the universities in a total performance. In my analysis I use different methods and visualization to have a better understanding of the dataset and using a Tableau Dashboard where you can interact and see for each university for the year 2024 informations like its general rank over the years, all the rankings of 2024 compared with the previous year's performance, the gender distribution of the university, how many international students prefer it, and which are the top universities in the country that this university belongs. <br>

### Online Shopping Analysis for 2019

**Description:** The dataset that is used in this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets and it has many information about customers transactions in an online shop. In our EDA we are answering questions like:
<br>
* How many female and male customers the shop has.
* How many coupons are used for different discount types (10%, 20%, 30%).
* How the average price performs for each month (max, min, mean and outliers.)
* Which product is prefered from males/females.
* How top 3 products of the shop perform for each month.
<br>
In general, we will try to derive online shopping trends and patterns for the customers that uses this platform to shop.
<br>
In addition, we created a dashboard using Tableau Public were we made a customer loyalty and a market basket analysis.

### Amazon's Product Analysis for year 2019

**Description:** The dataset was downloaded by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ and it contains 12 different csv files, each for every month's sales on Amazon for different products. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, save the results into a csv file for all the months together and finally visualization using different ways with Python and Tableau for an interactive dashboard. <br>

### Student Mental Health

**Description:** The dataset was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University student in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health. The data set was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/  The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values. Vvisualization using pivot tables in Excel. <br>

### Global Life expectancy and Europian Analysis

**Description:** In this project I use a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/ which contains Life expectancy of all the countries for the years and Continents for the years 1543 to 2019. I am using jupyter Notebook to clean explore and visualize my dataset. I am also using IBM Watson Studio in order to make more interactive Dashboards. <br>
