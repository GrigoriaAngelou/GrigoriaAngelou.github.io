In this section I will try to describe, as briefly as I can, the personal projects that I am doing in order to learn and master new skills in Data Analysis.

The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, save the results into a csv file for all the months together and finally visualization using different ways with Python and Tableau for an interactive dashboard. <br>
