# Grigoria Angelou - Portfolio

## About
Hi! I am Grigoria Angelou. I have a Master Degree in Statistics, a Bachelor in Mathematics,
and recently I took a course for Data Analysis at Coursera.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, track my progress in Data Analysis and share my personal projects.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will try to describe, as briefly as I can, the personal projects that I am doing in order to learn and master new skills in Data Analysis.

### Amazon's Product Analysis for year 2019

**Description:** The dataset was downloaded by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ and it contains 12 different csv files, each for every month's sales on Amazon for different products. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, save the results into a csv file for all the months together and finally visualization using different ways with Python and Tableau for an interactive dashboard. <br>

### Student Mental Health

**Description:** The dataset was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University student in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health. The data set was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/  The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values. Vvisualization using pivot tables in Excel. <br>

### Global Life expectancy and Europian Analysis

**Description:** In this project I use a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/ which contains Life expectancy of all the countries for the years and Continents for the years 1543 to 2019. I am using jupyter Notebook to clean explore and visualize my dataset. I am also using IBM Watson Studio in order to make more interactive Dashboards.
